## Decision Tree

```
User asks about networking
  |-- Route-level data loading (web, SDK 55+)?
  |   \-- Expo Router loaders — see references/expo-router-loaders.md
  |
  |-- Basic fetch?
  |   \-- Use fetch API with error handling
  |
  |-- Need caching/state management?
  |   |-- Complex app -> React Query (TanStack Query)
  |   \-- Simpler needs -> SWR or custom hooks
  |
  |-- Authentication?
  |   |-- Token storage -> expo-secure-store
  |   \-- Token refresh -> Implement refresh flow
  |
  |-- Error handling?
  |   |-- Network errors -> Check connectivity first
  |   |-- HTTP errors -> Parse response, throw typed errors
  |   \-- Retries -> Exponential backoff
  |
  |-- Offline support?
  |   |-- Check status -> NetInfo
  |   \-- Queue requests -> React Query persistence
  |
  |-- Environment/API config?
  |   |-- Client-side URLs -> EXPO_PUBLIC_ prefix in .env
  |   |-- Server secrets -> Non-prefixed env vars (API routes only)
  |   \-- Multiple environments -> .env.development, .env.production
  |
  \-- Performance?
      |-- Caching -> React Query with staleTime
      |-- Deduplication -> React Query handles this
      \-- Cancellation -> AbortController or React Query
```

## Common Mistakes

**Wrong: No error handling**

```tsx
const data = await fetch(url).then((r) => r.json());
```

**Right: Check response status**

```tsx
const response = await fetch(url);
if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
const data = await response.json();
```

**Wrong: Storing tokens in AsyncStorage**

```tsx
await AsyncStorage.setItem("token", token); // Not secure!
```

**Right: Use SecureStore for sensitive data**

```tsx
await SecureStore.setItemAsync("token", token);
```

## Example Invocations

User: "How do I make API calls in React Native?"
-> Use fetch, wrap with error handling

User: "Should I use React Query or SWR?"
-> React Query for complex apps, SWR for simpler needs

User: "My app needs to work offline"
-> Use NetInfo for status, React Query persistence for caching

User: "How do I handle authentication tokens?"
-> Store in expo-secure-store, implement refresh flow

User: "API calls are slow"
-> Check caching strategy, use React Query staleTime

User: "How do I configure different API URLs for dev and prod?"
-> Use EXPO*PUBLIC* env vars with .env.development and .env.production files

User: "Where should I put my API key?"
-> Client-safe keys: EXPO*PUBLIC* in .env. Secret keys: non-prefixed env vars in API routes only

User: "How do I load data for a page in Expo Router?"
-> See references/expo-router-loaders.md for route-level loaders (web, SDK 55+). For native, use React Query or fetch.
